As aUX/UI Designer I was in charge of ideating, designing and prototyping a solution based on existing user requirements that resulted from a research performed by a third party.
The product was created ased on a existing design system that was adapted to fit the design and user's needs. As the design system grew I got to manage DS updates, new components, color palette changes, etc.`,

        In this case the users had a lot of background knowledge on the platform
        and the tasks they could perform, so when receiving user feedback they
        usually preferred a kind of free roam experience that allowed them to
        seek what they specifically needed without having to follow a pre-set
        path that made it long and tasking.<br /><br />We resolved into a good
        solution doing the following:<br /><br />&zwj;<strong
          >User research:
        </strong>a solutions manager gathered user feedback on which features
        were most valuable to them and the kind of experience they would like to
        have.<br /><br />&zwj;<strong>Prioritization: </strong>worked with the
        business to prioritize features, divided into must haves and nice to
        haves.Having this we came up with a solution that could satisfy
        everyone's needs. The end product was a very clean custom dashboard
        experience with overview widgets that presented a clear resume of all
        relevant data, but also allowed the users to easily dig deeper into
        anything they needed. Featuring customizable data visualization, reports
        and trends.An experience that was not so overwhelming on new users but
        direct enough for experienced users as well.
